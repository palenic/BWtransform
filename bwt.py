""" Burrows-Wheeler transform

The Burrows-Wheeler transform is a very popular string manipulation 
algorithm at the basis of many bioinformatics tools as well as 
compression algorithms. This module provides functions for computing 
and inverting the Burrows-Wheeler transform on any input sequence 
given as a string.

Functions
--------
bwInverse(y)
    Invert the BW transform
bwTransform(x)
    Computes the BW transform
    
Notes
--------
Explanation of the algorithm used can be found in the help pages 
for the functions.

    Notes
    --------
    Implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler compression transformation, 
    originally described in [1]_, via construction of the suffix array, 
    as explained in section 2.2 of [2]_.
    The BWT of a string is obtained by definining a matrix of sorted 
    rotations of the string after adding a terminator character; 
    if the input is "hello":
    HELLO$       $HELLO
    ELLO$H       ELLO$H
    LLO$HE  -->  HELLO$
    LO$HEL       LLO$HE
    O$HELL       LO$HEL
    $HELLO       O$HELL
    The transform is the last column of the sorted matrix.
    The function adds a terminator $ to the string and derives a suffix 
    array S, which is an array containing the start position of all 
    suffixes sorted lexicographically. The BWT of X is defined as B[i]=$ 
    when S(i)=0 and B[i]=X[S(i)âˆ’1] otherwise; this is another way to 
    obtain the last column of the matrix without performing the rotations.

    Notes
    --------
    Implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler decompression as described 
    in [1]_, section 4.2. The transformed string y is the last column of
    the sorted matrix of rotations of the original string (L). We can 
    obtain the first column F by sorting lexicographically the characters 
    in L. Given how the matrix is built:
        1. L[i] cyclicly precedes F[i] in S for each i 
    To invert the transformation, we need to find a vector T that describes 
    the correspondence between each character in L and F such that: 
        2. F[T[j]]=L[j]
    Substituting i=T[j], from 1. we obtain:
        3. L[T[j]] precedes F[T[j]]
    From 2. we obtain:
        4. L[T[j]] cyclicly precedes L[j]
    Starting from the terminator character $=L[i], which is the last 
    character of S, L[T[i]] precedes it in S; then, substituting j=T[i], 
    L[T[j]] precedes T[j], and so on; this way, we reconstruct S back to 
    front.
    The function constructs an array P[N] and a dictionary C. C[ch] is the 
    total number of instances in L (the transformed string) of characters 
    preceding ch in the alphabet. P[i] is the number of instances of 
    character L[i] in the prefix L[0:i] of L. 
    T is defined as T[i]=P[i]+C[L[i]] for each i. In fact, the match of 
    L[i] in F can be found without building F by summing up
    a. how many characters in total precede L[i] in L (stored in C[L[i]]) 
    b. how many of the same character precede it in L[0:i] (stored in P[i])
